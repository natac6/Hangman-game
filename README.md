START::: The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Here's how it works in this particular implementation:

Initialization (startGame()):
The game begins when the startGame function is called.
It selects a random word from the words array and initializes the guessedWord array with underscores for each letter.
The incorrectGuesses counter is set to 0.
User Interface:
The HTML provides a simple interface with a container, the word display (word-container), a section for incorrect guesses (guesses-container), an on-screen keyboard (keyboard), and a message area (message).
Word Display:
The word to be guessed is displayed with underscores initially in the word-container.
On-Screen Keyboard:
The on-screen keyboard allows users to click on letters to make guesses.
Handling Guesses (handleGuess()):
When a letter is clicked, the handleGuess function checks if the letter is in the word.
If correct, the corresponding underscores in guessedWord are replaced with the guessed letter.
If incorrect, the incorrectGuesses counter is incremented.
Game Progress:
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the entire word or exceeds the maximum allowed incorrect guesses (maxIncorrectGuesses).
Outcome:
If the player guesses the word, they win. If they reach the maximum incorrect guesses, they lose.
Resetting the Game (Play Again):
The game can be reset by clicking anywhere on the page after losing or winning. This triggers the event listener that resets the game.

Favorite Code:
I appreciate the simplicity and effectiveness of the updateGuessedWord function. It efficiently updates the guessedWord array based on correct guesses, and displayWord() ensures the user sees the updated word on the screen.


Overcoming Challenges:
One challenging aspect could be ensuring that the game logic works seamlessly, especially with functions like collision detection in a game loop. This specific Hangman implementation, being a text-based game, might not have encountered the same challenges as a graphical game. However, for graphical games, managing animations, collisions, and rendering efficiently can be complex.

Two Things to Add:
Difficulty Levels:
Introduce difficulty levels that affect the word pool or the allowed incorrect guesses, providing a more tailored experience for players of different skill levels.
Visual Enhancements:
Consider adding more visual elements like animations, sound effects, or themed graphics to enhance the overall user experience and engagement.
